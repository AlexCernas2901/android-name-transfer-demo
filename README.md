# android-name-transfer-demo

This repository contains a small sample application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. This application allows users to input a name in a text field, and upon clicking the "Send" button, it transfers that name to a second activity. In the second activity, the name is displayed with the caption "My name is:" followed by the user-entered name. A "Back" button is also provided to return to the main activity.

This simple application demonstrates how to pass data (in this case, a name) between activities in an Android application using the concept of Intents.

## Features

- Input a name in the main activity.
- Pass the name to a second activity.
- Display the name with a caption in the second activity.
- Navigate back to the main activity.
